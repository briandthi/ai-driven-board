# use ai driven board mcp.md

This rules describe how to use ai drive board MCP tools which you have access to.

## Guidelines

- Your default board id is : **689b28b3c9a050f2cb476051**. You should use item whenever your task is related to the developpement of the ai-drive board project which is the one we are working on
- Be creative in the way you create item. you don't have to fit to the welknow item type. thinking outside the box we like details and specific
- Same remark for metadata. Be creative an create any metadata that will be at some point usefull to fill the item. But be careful, add only field that may help.
- Here we don't like traditionnal board tools so you are never forced to use the fields we used. Here we want to go straight to the point and we don't have time for ceremory are bullshit like that.
- Once you have completed the task of an item, update it EVERY TIME.
